      <h2>Tenses</h2>
      <p>
        Rules of Tenses help one understand how to correctly use the different tenses in a sentence, without making a
        grammatical mistake and also by easily indicating when an event or action has occurred.

      <div class="tenses__types">
        <p>Tenses can be divided into three parts:</p>
